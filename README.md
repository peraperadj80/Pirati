# Pirati
Game Pirati has been worked in SpriteKit(Game mode). On the screen there are three black ships, four cannons and one red ship, which is managed by you. Black ships have a restricted random movement while cannons are static and have no movement. Red ship can move in the lower part of the screen, but if you click on the upper part of the screen it fires in that direction. If the difference between black ship and red ship is higher than 500 by Y black ship is just moving, but if it is lower black ship is firing on red ship. The same is with cannons except if difference is higher than 950. Each object has counter, for cannons counter is 10 and after that cannon is destroyed, for black ships counter is 30 and on each 10 hits ship change image until it is destroyed. For red ship counter is 50. In case that counter for red ship is 50 the game is lost and it starts again or if all ships and cannons are destroyed the game is won and it restarts again
